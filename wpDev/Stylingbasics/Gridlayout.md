        If a series of horizontal & vertical lines are drawn on a plane a grid of cells will be formed. In such a grid there are two types of tracks if we consider only one orientation of tracks - row (when consider only horizontal lines) & column (when consider vertical lines). We can consider different areas in such grids in terms of cells. A single cell is smallest unit of area. But bigger areas can be identified by combining two or more adjacent cells.

        CSS grid properties allow to define such row & column tracks and reference areas formed through the intersection of them to place child elements in them. Two types of elemets are there in a CSS grid - container element and chid elements. There are a set of properties specific to container element and another set relevant to child elements of it. Container element specific properties are to define a grid and child elements specific properties are for the placement of them in the grid areas.
