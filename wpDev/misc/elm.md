                        The tag specifies what type of element has to be created and also indicates the intented usage of it. Intended usage of the elements defines the semantic meaning of them. For example, usage of the tag 'main' is to mark the main content in the document, 'h1' is to specify the main heading in a section and so on. Using elements based on their semantic meaning is important for maitanence of the document source. It means, when it is required to modify or add contents latter it is easy to understand different parts of the page if they are specified using appropriate tags. It is also usefull to consistently style similar parts of different pages in a website. HTML documents are processed mostly by web browsers in order to display it on screens. But it can be processed by screen readers to read alound, search engines during web crawling etc. In such cases it is easier for software agents to interpret different parts of the page if they are specified using proper semantic tags.

        The definition of an element includes a tag and its associated attributes. There is a set of attributes that is common to all the elements and for some elements there is a set of attributes in addition to the common ones that is specific to that particular element. The attributes add additional features or behaviors to the element if specified as part of its definition in HTML documents. There is no standared styling associated with any element. It is upto the browsers to provide a default styling for each element and that will vary across different browsers.
        
        Each HTML element has its content model which defines what is allowed as descendant of it. Most of the elements allow text and other elements as content within.
